Password Generator App
Kept the index.html file the same
Changed some of the styling to the style.css file to my liking
defined the arrays to use for the password generator
defined the variables with which we will use to generate the password
used prompts to alert the user how many characters they want in their password. Choices are between 8-128 characters
used prompts and confirmLength to confirm the users input on how long they want their password
define the parameters for the password by asking a series of question
using loop to loop if the answer is outside the parameter of the function
Assigned an action to the password parameters
used var randomPassword = '' to be filled based on looping random characters
used function writePassword() to generate and write the password to the card
